# Avrora-Logic-Game

This project was written during winter-summer 2020 for an automated training system "Avrora".
It is a rethinking of [K. Polyakov](https://www.kpolyakov.spb.ru/) "Logic" game and based on [Circuit simulator](https://lushprojects.com/circuitjs/) by [Paul Falstad](https://github.com/pfalstad/circuitjs1) and [Iain Sharp](https://github.com/sharpie7/circuitjs1).
This App implements logic game based on logic gates system.

# Project installation
The tools you will need to build the project are:

Eclipse, Oxygen version.
GWT plugin for Eclipse.
Install "Eclipse for Java developers" from [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/). To add the GWT plugin for Eclipse follow the instructions [here](https://gwt-plugins.github.io/documentation/gwt-eclipse-plugin/Download.html).

This repository is a project folder for your Eclipse project space. Once you have a local copy you can then build and run in development mode or build for deployment. Running in super development mode is done by clicking on the "run"->"run as" icon on the toolbar and choosing "GWT Development mode with Jetty". Building for deployment is done by selecting the project root node and using the GWT button on the Eclipse taskbar and choosing "GWT Compile Project...".

GWT will build its output in to the "war" directory.
